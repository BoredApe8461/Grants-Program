1. Grant application as PR to the `applications` folder.
2. Sign off T&Cs via CLA-bot.
3. Committee can issue commments and approve or reject the PR.
4. When 1/3 of the Committee approves then the application is accepted.
5. Approved grantee (same Github account as applicant) can submit a PR to the relevant folder in the `applications` folder delivering a milestone.
6. After delivery PR is submitted then grantee needs to fill out the invoice form (follow [invoice guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14fMb04NvkkI3EJddyNOb0UC6TPtsYcCc/view?ts=5dd29a1f), allow for attachment, verify GH account).
7. Grants Evaluators can accept the PR to accept the deliverable.
8. Notification is issued to the Operations Team once delivery was accepted or after 2 weeks from submission.
9. Operations Team makes the payment they recieve the notification with the details from the invoice form.

Grant application can be amended at any time, leading to a need for reevaluation by the Committee.
