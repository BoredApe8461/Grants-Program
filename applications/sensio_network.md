## Project Description :page_facing_up:

SensioNetwork is a decentralized protocol that empowers content creators to sign, permanently record, and claim statements about their ownerships and copyrights, giving them opportunity to license their work and get [paid](https://www.sensio.group/#people-to-people-marketplace). SensioNetwork is an integral part of much larger project called [Sensio](https://sensio.group) which consist of two more sub-projects.

SensioNetwork's applications(dApps) ([Sensio Photo](https://www.sensio.group/sensio-photo) and [People-2-People marketplace](https://www.sensio.group/#people-to-people-marketplace)) have a potential of reaching millions of people and boosting the ecosystem's reputation and adoption.

SensioNetwork will be implemented as a parachain with its own token (THT) using Substrate. We will run several full nodes to help the Kusama/Polkadot networks as well enough collator nodes to secure the SensioNetwork parachain. For the copyright/ownership transfers we will be using smart contracts and which can be extended to use any crypto/fiat currency.

SensioNetwork is the backbone of the Sensio project. Building the SensioNetwork with Substrate and Polkadot ecosystem, matches with the our principles and views on interoperability and interconnectivity. One of the Sensio's goal is to establish fair and trustworthy multimedia market, primarily for photography and video, and we can do that only with flexible blockchain solution.
