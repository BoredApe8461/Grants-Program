# Open Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** Sunrise DEX
* **Team Name:** Sunrise Protocol
* **Payment Address:** bc1qv2jhx5ykm4szuu9lp4ehtxclf67v6n7dprcgyl 

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

Sunrise Protocol is building a decentralized protocol on a dedicated Polkadot parachain. It will enable deep liquidity starting with support for the exchange of tokens on Sunrise Chain, Ethereum, and all parachains. Sunrise will support additional blockchains in the future. 

Our Decentralized EXchange (DEX) uses a bonding curve factory which supports liquidity pools for unpegged tokens such as ETH,DOT, LINK, ACA etc. Sunrise will also support stable coin pools offering low slippage (e.g. DAI,USDT) and moving forward stable coins with different pegs (e.g. srsUSD, srsCNY).

**Deployment**

This phase of the project will be built and deployed on a parachain on Rococo. Our standalone parachain [Sunrise Protocol Daybreak](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fdaybreak.sunriseprotocol.com%3A443#/explorer) is the precursor to this. We are also evaluating the ability to deploy an Intrachain DEX (running on our partners) parachain, this will be done either publishing a DEX crate or directly contributing to partners codebase via a fork of their repository.

**Polkadot Ecosystem Benefits**

This protocol lays the foundation for asset exchange, stable coins and advanced aggregation. This will attract the decentralized finance community, provide more liquidity and drive adoption for Polkadot. The DEX is multi-platform and bridges across parachains and as such can benefit the whole Polkadot community providing liquidity across multiple DeFi initiatives. Finally, we see there are gaps in the current DEX Approaches, this includes stable coin support, limit order functionality and compliance functionality.

**Why are we creating this project**

This project provides a foundational layer for the Sunrise Protocol.

Our team consists of founders, researchers, builders and strategists for blockchain and decentralized finance. We have built a layer 1 blockchain at Harmony (public blockchain with sharding and open staking), have launched private permissioned chains on ethereum and hyperledger fabric  and have been actively involved in the Decentralized Finance community. We have chosen to build this project on Polkadot because Substrate allows us to focus on the Protocol and business logic. We feel the Partners in the ecosystem are laying the foundation for interoperable decentralization and we want to contribute to the community.

### Project Details 
Please see [this product overview presentation](https://about.sunriseprotocol.com) and [Sunrise Protocol Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.sunriseprotocol.com) for an overview of the Sunrise Protocol vision.

**This Project is specifically for the Sunrise Dex Factory which is a foundational component for the Sunrise Protocol**

The Sunrise Decentralized Exchange (DEX) combines the use of multiple bonding curves and price oracles to support liquidity pools for unpegged tokens, and stable coin pools. Below is an excerpt from the [Sunrise Protocol Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.sunriseprotocol.com) 

#### 3. Sunrise DEX Factory

The Sunrise DEX Factory will support the creation of Liquidity Pool Contracts.  The bonding curves for these liquidity pools, will be slightly different depending on the use case. Each exchange contract can be configured to the specific needs of the liquidity pool.

##### 3.1 Sunrise Factory/Registry Contract

All contracts will have a uniform interface for liquidity management and swap management. Thus abstracting away the underlying complexity from liquidity providers and traders, giving them a uniform mechanism to interact with all Sunrise liquidity pools.

Below is a list of the configuration parameters input into the factory contract when creating an exchange contract.

**Sunrise Protocol Seven Key Parameters**

1. **T** Token Weight : Weight of Token in the Pool
    - Tokens:  **T**. Assume there are **n** type of tokens in one liquidity pool, we denote them as **(T1,T2,... Tn)**.
    - weight parameter: **Wi(0<=Wi<=1)** is the parameter of token **i** in our model, which is a constant defined when creating the pool. We always assume **the sum of Wi =1**.
    - initial balance: **(x1,x2,...,xn)**  are the initial amounts a liquidity provider puts into a liquidity pool.
2. **epsilon** Fees : Liquidity Provider and Protocol Fees
3. **beta** Depth : Depth of Pool before slippage occurs
4. **Delta** Slippage: The rate at which price slippage increases
5. **Alpha** Max Min: Maximum and Minimum Token allocation for each reserve
6. **lambda** Dynamic fees : Unbalancing Penalty Fees
7. **k**  Market Price Alignment: Alignment of the Bonding Curve with Price Oracle 

**The three types of bonding curves use the following variables**

3.1 MultiToken Bonding Curve (1,2)

3.2 StableCoin Bonding Curve (1,2,3,4,5,6)

3.3. Proactive Bonding Curve (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

**There will be default values for each of these parameters based on the Bonding Curve Type.**

When not utilized the variable is set to a default value, usually zero.

#### Sunrise Protocol Overview

Sunrise Protocol is creating an open decentralized financial framework. Sunrise is building a complete suite of financial tools and non custodial services within a compliant framework . This will be done in a trustless decentralized environment. With the goal of disrupting and streamlining current solutions offered by Centralized Exchanges and International remittances.


**The following information is a short summary of the other features of the protocol**

Sunrise Bridge is used to create a multi-platform, multi-asset protocol using cryptocurrencies (tokens) as building blocks. We will start with Polkadot parachains, ERC-20 tokens and then other blockchains.

Sunrise Chain will be implemented using a decentralized protocol on a dedicated parachain built on polkadot. 

Once the primitives of a multi-platform, multi-asset DEX have been realized, decentralized financial protocols can leverage this for their liquidity needs. 

Sunrise Protocol will then add limit orders, a compliance framework and smart wallet functionality to give cost effective alternatives to Centralized Exchanges and International remittances.

Below are the high level github repositories for the Sunrise Protocol.

- [Sunrise Chain](https://github.com/sunriseprotocol/sunrise): Based of substrate cumulus template))
- Sunrise DApp  react based frontend
- [Sunrise Explorer](https://github.com/sunriseprotocol/apps): forked from polkadot-js/apps
- Sunrise js: fork of polkadot.js
- [Sunrise faucet-bot](https://github.com/sunriseprotocol/faucet-bot): faucet functionality
- Sunrise Wallet : Mobile Wallet

### Ecosystem Fit 
Sunrise Protocol is building an open decentralized framework. This grant application is for the Sunrise DEX, a sub-component of the larger Sunrise Protocol. 

We have done a comprehensive review of the other DEX projects which include Polkaswap, Reef, Mangata, HydraDx, Polkadex, Subdex. We see there are gaps in the current DEX Approaches, these include stable coin support, limit order functionality and compliance functionality. We feel that these DEX projects cannot be leveraged as part of our protocol due to the mentioned gaps and the different technical approaches. 

We are the only protocol to offer multi-asset pools, optimized stable coin support, multiple bonding curves, adjustable transaction fees and limit orders.  We combine this with bridging capabilities for multi-platform support, limit order capabilities, combinatorial staking for better rewards, synthetic asset support, a compliance framework and smart wallet functionality to drive mass adoption.

This application is specific to the DEX Pallet and lays the foundation for the larger vision which can be seen in our [draft white paper](https://whitepaper.sunriseprotocol.com).

The following protocols offer specific functionality and are often leaders in their respective areas.  The points below walk through a chronological evolution of DEX and cross-chain capabilities.

- Uniswap introduced a simple bonding curve supporting two token liquidity pools.
- It later introduced itâ€™s UNI token which is now table stakes for all Decentralized Exchanges, Sunrise Protocol extends this combining trading, protocol and liquidity balance rewards.
- Multi Asset Pools were introduced by Balancer and adopted by Curve who introduced the first bonding curve to support stable coins.
- Price Oracles being utilized by Automated Market Makers are being evaluated by Sunrise and DodoEx wrote a good white paper about the topic.
- Sunrise protocol adds to this with multipe bonding curves which supports multi asset pools, stable coins, and traditional tokens.
- Our Liquidity Providers can set the transaction fees when creating a Liquidity Pool similar to Balancer and Curve.
- We also introduce limit orders powered by our unique off-chain worker capabilities.
- Polkadot and Ethereum are supported initially with more platforms to come powered by our integrated bridging technology.
- Reef and PolkaDex are also building on Polkadot which provides the ability to create dedicated parachains.
- A Compliance Framework will be leveraged by Sunrise Protocol to provide cost effective solutions which compete with Centralized Exchanges and International remittances.
- Smart Wallet Functionality will also be provided to simplify the user experience and drive mass adoption.

## Additional Information

Work done so far has included research and prototyping.

No other teams have contributed to the project.

This is Sunrise Protocol's first grant application. However John wrote a previous application for a [DEX Pallet](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/pull/351). The original application has been archived and the vision has been refined based on feedback from David Hawig and knowledge gained working on substrate over the past months by the Sunrise Protocol team.
