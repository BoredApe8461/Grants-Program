# Open Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** Starry Protocol
* **Proposer:** [Starry Network](https://github.com/Starry-Network)
* **Payment Address:** 0xe29DE8c6088d241647e6456F8b4755a3D0f7c8B1

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
### Overview

It is well known that most NFTs are traded either directly or by auction, and the single NFT limit the flexibility of NFTs in some ways.

Splittable NFT will bring more possibilities for NFT ecosystem. For example, buying SubNFTs on bonding curve will allow for better pricing of works, while NFTs that are otherwise very expensive can be collected by more people, and will also have applications in rare tickets, rare music works on sale, etc.

Starry is developing an NFT Wrapper and can split an NFT into some sub nft or fungible token or split a set of NFTs into fungible tokens.

### Project Details 
The Starry Protocol contains four parts: Pallet_NFT, Pallet_SubNFT, Pallet_EX, Frontend

### Ecosystem Fit 
What is the difference between SubNFT and Erc-1155?

erc-1155's multiple NFT is Semi-fungible tokens, these tokens use same token_id.

SubNFT splits single NFT into different NFTs, each SubNFT has its own token_id. As a result, subNFT is even rarer and suitable as a collector's item.

For example, we can use Semi-fungible tokens to create general admission tickets for a concert, and then use SubNFT to create commemorative tickets.

#### Architecture



![](https://github.com/Starry-Network/frontend_mvp/blob/main/public/images/architecture.png?raw=true)



**Pallet_NFT**

Creates, destroys, transfers NFT. modifies existing Pallet-NFT so that they can create multiple NFT

**Pallet_SubNFT**

An NFT Wrapper to split NFTs into SubNFTs or fungible tokens, or a set of NFTs into fungible tokens

**Pallet_EX**

exchange NFT (including buying SubNFTs with bonding curve/one price) and send royalties generated by each transaction to the creator

**FrontEnd**

Interaction with users. Here is a  [demo](https://friendly-mclean-d455eb.netlify.app/)

## Future Plans
- Implementing auction functions (English auction, Dutch auction).
- Add comments, favorites and data analysis to Starry to improve the Starry ecosystem.
- Simplify the usage process and make NFT more friendly to newcomers.
- Implementing cross-chain transmission NFT.
- Lead the community to hold online exhibitions and comment on good NFT works, using tokens to promote these beneficial behaviors.
