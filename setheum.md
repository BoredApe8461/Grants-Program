Open Grant Proposal
**Setheum DeFi & DeCo Network by Setheum Labs**

   Setheum Labs props, supports, nurtures and stewards applications in the fields of Decentralized Finance protocols particularly e-commerce (Decentralized E-Commerce or DeCo) and protocols that can serve as open finance building blocks such as stable currency and synthetic assets. Setheum Network is a focal R&D project initiated the Setheum Labs. Setheum Labs is founded by Muhammad-Jibril B.A. participant of the Polkadot ecosystem. Deco is now like a store where anyone can sell anything, it is basically a financial framework and infrastructure for normal eCommerce platforms/apps to integrate or build their payment gateways on to give free discounts to their users/customers through Setheum's elastic distribution of stablecoins by the SERP-TES.

    Project:         Setheum Network
    Proposer:        JBA-Khalifa
    Payment Address: 1EDXptvCZo1sWpT8BFTvdopZbBShhurkGA

**Project Description**

   We are building a decentralized, cross-chain, community-owned DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
   and DeCo (Decentralized Commerce) system - the Setheum Network, to enable true economic interoperability, cross-chain liquidity and scalability. Along with the system, we are also building an economic model and governance framework to sustain the development, and continuous participation in the Polkadot ecosystem (e.g. as parachain and will setup a non-profit foundation to foster development on the Polkadot Ecosystem - especially in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia), until ultimately transitioning the network to community ownership. The Setheum Network will serve as a building block for DeCo and DeFi applications such as SettIndex in the Polkadot Ecosystem, and will provide new use cases for quality assets in the Polkadot ecosystem, such as DOT and new upcoming Polkadot projects such as Kylin, ChainLink, Open Ethereum et al..

**Overview*

The Setheum Network MVP will include the following parts

   **The STP258 (Setheum Tokenization Protocol [to-fiat]) Stablecoin Standard Module:** 34 fiat currencies that can be spent on SettPay and are also represented in a basket token.
   **The SERP (Setheum Elastic Reserve Protocol) Token Elasticity Module:** Designed to make cryptocurrencies that are backed by other cryptocurrencies with the PES (Price Elasticity of Supply) algorithm utilized for token elasticity of supply (TES) algorithm.
   **Setheum Chain using Substrate** to enable all in one DeFi & DeCo development and interoperability including the following modules:
        The STP258 Module, which we are developing and is open-sourced for the community to use and build upon
        The SERP Module, which we are developing and is open-sourced for the community to use and build upon
        Various modules specific to manage Distribution of STP258/SERP-TES Monetary Issuance, Ecommerce payment, et al.
   **SettPay:** The Setheum Wallet for the STP258 Stablecoins, to function like a traditional Bank. Later on to add features to pay on ecommerce platforms with any cryptocurrency through the STP258 protocol, to enable minting of STP258 stablecoins, peer to peer transactions, and later on in the near future we will add Subsocial in the SettPay Dapp as a micro-service just like Alipay chat in AliPay.

The Setheum Labs Team

   I designd, drafted and published the White Pagers of Setheum and even of the Future Plans we have for Setheum, like Synthetic Assets, margin trading, money market, liquidity staking et al
    https://github.com/Setheum-Labs/Setheum-Labs-White-Papers

**Ecosystem Fit**

   Setheum offers a stablecoin market unlike any orher, unique. Libra offers a basket token pegged to various fiat currencies that can only be spent as a basket token, we offer a basket token of Fully Decentralized Algorithmic Crypto-Collateralized Elastic Stablecoins backed by our governance token. I invented the SERP-TES and the STP258 Protocols. And the STP20 Protocol is coming soon. We designed everything from the ground up to repell any economic catastrophy that Libra can not withstand. We developed a Monetary Policy that even large Banks would love to immitate and we do it under the Apache 2.0 License.

**Development Roadmap**

   The Setheum Network MVP will be a 12 week project, aims to deliver a running MVP Substrate chain testnet providing algorithmically elastic stablecoins - the STP258 Sett tokens. Upon the testnet launch, we will implement a basic version of its economic model and work towards a Canary Network Launch and an Initial Parachain Offering of the Canary network on Kusama. And then work towards launching the Mainnet with all of the future plans we provided above and move towards an Initial Parachain Offering (IPO) of the Mainnet of Setheum network, participation in the IPO auction will depend upon the readiness of the Polkadot network.

    We have designed, drafted and published the white papers with technical insight and spec.
    We haven't applied for any other Grants so far, but we applied for the Substrate Builders Program.
 We are providing the Entire Project under the **Apache 2.0 license**.
