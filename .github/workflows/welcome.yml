            As part of the Open Grants Program, we want to help winning teams acknowledge their 
            grants publicly while observing the foundation’s guidelines. To that end, we’ve created 
            a badge for grant-winning teams. Here is a link to the 
            [download and guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/grant-badge-guidelines.md). <br/><br/> 
            If you are interested in making an announcement about your grant and you would like us to broadcast it on our 
            media channels then please get in touch with us at grants.communications@web3.foundation prior to making the 
            announcement (at least two weeks notice is preferred) so that we can coordinate on timing and content.
