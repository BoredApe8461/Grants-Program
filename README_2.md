## :clipboard: About 

### Introduction

The Small Grants Program  aims to be:
- Fully transparent
- Simple
- Effective at allocating resources across projects which in view of the Grants Committee are beneficial to advancement of the Polkadot Ecosystem

The Web3 Foundation Small Grants Program focuses on technology grants up to $30k, which are tract completely transparent on GitHub. Look at [Web3 Foundation Grants](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/grants.md) for larger grants and partly private submissions. 

You can find our areas of interest [here](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/grants.md#areas-of-interest-for-technical-grants), as well as a list of previously accepted projects [here](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/accepted_grant_applications.md). 

### Team

**W3F Grants Committee**

The Committee consist of individuals who know the funding priorities of the Polkadot ecosystem. The Committee evaluates grant applications and provides feedback on these applications. 

**W3F Grants Evaluators**

Evaluators are individuals able to evaluate the technology delivered through the grants programme.

**W3F Operations Team**

Operations Team takes care of the legal setup, invoices and process payments. 

## :pencil: Process

1. **Grant application:**
    1. Fork this repository
    2. In the newly created fork, create a new folder with name of your project under [applications](./applications)
    3. Inside this new folder create a copy of the [application.md](./applications/application.md)
    4. Fill out the template with the details of your project.
    5. Once you have completed the application, click on "create new pull request".
2. Sign off T&Cs via CLA-bot.
3. Committee can issue comments and approve or reject the PR.
4. When 1/3 of the Committee approves then the application is accepted.
5. Approved grantee (same Github account as applicant) can submit a PR to the relevant folder in the `applications` folder delivering a milestone.
6. After delivery PR is submitted then grantee needs to fill out the invoice form (follow [invoice guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14fMb04NvkkI3EJddyNOb0UC6TPtsYcCc/view?ts=5dd29a1f), allow for attachment, verify GH account).
7. Grants Evaluators can accept the PR to accept the deliverable.
8. Notification is issued to the Operations Team once delivery was accepted or after 2 weeks from submission.
9. Operations Team makes the payment they recieve the notification with the details from the invoice form.

Grant application can be amended at any time, leading to a need for reevaluation by the Committee.
