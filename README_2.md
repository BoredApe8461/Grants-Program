## :clipboard: About 

### Introduction

The Open Grants Program aims to allocate resources across projects which are beneficial to the advancement of the Polkadot Ecosystem in the following way:
- Fully transparent
- Simple
- Effective  

The Web3 Foundation Open Grants Program focuses on technology grants up to **$30k**, which are tracked completely **transparent** on GitHub and paid in **BTC**. Additionally, the software of the project needs to be released under the Apache license version 2.0. 
Look at [Web3 Foundation Grants](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/grants.md) for larger grants, payments in other currencies and partly private submissions. 

You can find our areas of interest [here](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/grants.md#areas-of-interest-for-technical-grants), as well as a list of previously accepted projects [here](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/accepted_grant_applications.md).

## :pencil: Process

1. **Grant Application:**
    1. [Fork](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/fork) this repository
    2. In the newly created fork, create a **copy** of the [application-template.md](./applications/application-template.md). In the GitHub web interface, you, therefore, need to create a new file and copy the content of the [application-template.md](./applications/application-template.md) inside the new file. Don't change the template file directly!
    3. Label the file as "project_name.md".
    4. Fill out the template with the details of your project.
    5. Once you have completed the application, click on "create new pull request".
    6. Sign off the [terms and conditions](https://gist.github.com/Noc2/75bc58e8ce9b5d419ff883b0cf2b8c19) via the CLA assistant.
2. **Application Review:**
    1. Committee can issue comments and request changes on the PR.
    2. When 1/3 of the committee approves a pull request then the application is accepted.
3. **Milestone Delivery:**
    1. [Fork](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/fork) the [Grant Milestone Delivery](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery) repo with the **same GitHub account, which you used to submit the application!**
    2. In the newly created fork, create a **copy** of the [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md)
    3. Label the file as "project_name_milestone_number.md".
    4. Fill out the [invoice form](https://forms.gle/QvsbeSA3ziuC9k9b9).
    5. Fill out the template with the details of your milestone including a **link to the intial PR**.
    6. Once you have completed the application, click on "create new pull request".
4. **Milestone Review:**
    1. Evaluators can issue comments and request changes on the PR.
    2. Grants Evaluators can approve a pull request to accept the deliverable. 
5. **Milestone Payment:**
    1. Notification is issued to the Operations Team once the delivery was accepted or after 2 weeks without any feedback after the initial delivery. As soon as feedback is provided by the evaluators, this feedback first needs to be resolved.  
    2. Operations Team makes the payment to the BTC address specified in the initial application.

*Grant application can be amended at any time, leading to a need for reevaluation by the Committee.*
