## :clipboard: About 

### Introduction

The Open Grants Program  aims to be:
- Fully transparent
- Simple
- Effective at allocating resources across projects which are beneficial to advancement of the Polkadot Ecosystem

The Web3 Foundation Open Grants Program focuses on technology grants up to **$30k**, which are tracked completely **transparent** on GitHub and paid in **BTC or DOT**. Additionally, the software of the project needs to be released under the Apache license version 2.0.
